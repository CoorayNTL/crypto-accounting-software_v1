// In practice, the number of wallets per user can range from one to several, depending on individual choices and needs. For instance,
//  a user might use separate wallets for different cryptocurrencies,
//employ hardware wallets for long-term storage, and software wallets for daily transactions.


// Explanation:
// The Wallet model stores information about a userâ€™s crypto wallet, including the wallet address and the current balance of a particular crypto.
// The user() method defines a many-to-one relationship between wallets and users.
// The crypto() method defines a many-to-one relationship between wallets and the CryptoPrice model.
