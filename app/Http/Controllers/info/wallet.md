The query:

```php
$wallet = Wallet::where('user_id', Auth::id())->with('crypto')->find($id);
```

### **Explanation of `with('crypto')`**

The `with('crypto')` method is part of Laravel's **Eloquent eager loading** feature. It is used to load related models along with the main model in a single query, reducing the number of queries made to the database.

---

### **Breakdown of the Query**

1. **`Wallet::where('user_id', Auth::id())`**:
   - This filters the `wallets` table to find rows where the `user_id` matches the currently authenticated user (`Auth::id()`).

2. **`with('crypto')`**:
   - This tells Laravel to also load the related `crypto` model (defined in the `crypto()` method of the `Wallet` model) alongside the wallet.
   - The `crypto` relationship is defined in the `Wallet` model:
     ```php
     public function crypto()
     {
         return $this->belongsTo(CryptoPrice::class, 'crypto_id');
     }
     ```
   - This means that the `Wallet` model is related to the `CryptoPrice` model via the `crypto_id` foreign key.

3. **`find($id)`**:
   - This retrieves the specific wallet entry by its primary key (`id`) after applying the `where` and `with` conditions.

---

### **What `with('crypto')` Does**
- Without `with('crypto')`, if you access the `crypto` relationship on the `$wallet` object (e.g., `$wallet->crypto`), Laravel will execute an additional query to fetch the related cryptocurrency.

- With `with('crypto')`, Laravel includes the related `crypto` data in the initial query, avoiding the need for a separate query later.

---

### **Example**

Assume your `wallets` table has the following data:
| ID  | User ID | Crypto ID | Balance    | Wallet Address  |
|-----|---------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1   | 1       | 1         | 5.12345678 | 1A2B3C4D5E6F    |

And your `crypto_prices` table has:
| ID  | Symbol | Name      | Current Price |
|-----|--------|-----------|---------------|
| 1   | BTC    | Bitcoin   | 48000.123456  |

The query:
```php
$wallet = Wallet::where('user_id', Auth::id())->with('crypto')->find(1);
```

Will fetch:
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "user_id": 1,
    "crypto_id": 1,
    "balance": 5.12345678,
    "wallet_address": "1A2B3C4D5E6F",
    "crypto": {
        "id": 1,
        "symbol": "BTC",
        "name": "Bitcoin",
        "current_price": 48000.123456
    }
}
```

### **Benefits of `with()`**

1. **Performance**:
   - Reduces the number of queries by loading related data in a single query.
   - Without `with('crypto')`, accessing `$wallet->crypto` would result in an additional query for each wallet.

2. **Convenience**:
   - Simplifies the process of accessing related data.
   - The related `crypto` model is directly available as part of the `$wallet` object.

---

### **SQL Query Generated**
The `with('crypto')` generates a SQL query with a `JOIN` to fetch the related `crypto_prices` data. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM wallets
LEFT JOIN crypto_prices ON wallets.crypto_id = crypto_prices.id
WHERE wallets.user_id = 1 AND wallets.id = 1;
```
